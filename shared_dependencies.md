1. Scrapy: This is a Python library used for web scraping and is shared across "main.py", "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/spiders/poe_spider.py", "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/items.py", "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/pipelines.py", and "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/settings.py".

2. PoeItem: This is a data schema defined in "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/items.py" and used in "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/spiders/poe_spider.py" and "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/pipelines.py" to structure the scraped data.

3. JSON: This is the format in which the scraped data is stored. It is used in "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/pipelines.py".

4. Rules: The rules defined in ".rules/prevent-customer-logs.md" are shared as they apply to all the code written in the project.

5. Settings: The settings defined in "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/settings.py" are shared across "main.py", "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/spiders/poe_spider.py", "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/items.py", and "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/pipelines.py".

6. Spider Name: The name of the spider defined in "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/spiders/poe_spider.py" is shared with "main.py" as it is used to initiate the scraping process.

7. DOM Elements: The id names of DOM elements that the spider will interact with are shared between "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/spiders/poe_spider.py" and potentially "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/items.py" and "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/pipelines.py", depending on how the data is processed and stored.

8. Functions: The function names in "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/spiders/poe_spider.py", "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/items.py", and "poe_scraper/poe_scraper/pipelines.py" are shared as they are likely to be called from "main.py".
